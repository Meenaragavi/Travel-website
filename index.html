          <h2>About Maldives</h2>
                    <p>The Maldives, known to the locals in their native language (Dhivehi) as Dhivehi Raajje, are an archipelago of 1,192 coral islands grouped into 26 natural coral atolls in the Indian Ocean. They lie south-southwest of India and west of Sri Lanka. None of the coral islands measures more than 1.8 metres above sea level.

Only 192 islands are inhabited by its 300,000 inhabitants. The rest of the islands remain virgin islands except for more than 100 islands that have been developed for the top end of the tourist market.

With its abundant sea life and sandy beaches, The Maldives is portrayed by travel companies as a tropical paradise. Maldives was for the most part unknown to tourists until the early 1970s.

The economy revolves around tourism, and fisheries. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP. Over 90% of the state government income comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.</p>

              <h2>Transporation in maldives</h2>
                  <h2> Seaplane</h2><p>
A unique adventure in itself, seaplanes are a quick way to reach the resorts located further from the airport. Flying at a low altitude, they offer you the most breath taking views of Maldives.

There are two main operators for air-taxis in Maldives- Maldivian Air Taxi and Trans Maldivian Airways. They can carry up to 15 passengers at one time and the maximum time it takes from Male to the far-flung resorts is 90 minutes. However, keep in mind that these do not operate at night.

<h2>Boat</h2>
Hopping on and off ferries and speedboats is the best way to get around the island nation of Maldives. Dhoni charters and speedboats are available for hire at Male and all nearby islands.
                  Taxi boats are used to take tourists to and from the islands in the North and South Atolls. These come in all shapes and sizes depending on the resort you are staying in. Bear in mind that boats do not operate after dark.
                  <h2>Taxi</h2>
Taxi service is available only in two cities where road transport is a popular option - Male and Addu.

<h2>Dhoni</h2>
This is the local boat used by locals for travelling and can get you to your destination in no time. A gentler mode of transportation but no less exciting, dhoni is a great way to experience island hopping.

If you go along the waterfront to the eastern end of Boduthakurufaanu Magu by the airport ferry jetty, you’ll find many dhonis waiting in the harbour. Depending on your bargaining skills, it can cost anywhere between Rf1000 and Rf1500 for a day.</p>
              <h2>Ferry </h2>                 <p>Ferries are the cheapest option when it comes to commuting between the islands of Maldives, with fares varying between MVR 30 and MVR 60 for over a five hours long journey. Getting from the airport to Male via ferry costs around MVR 40 per person, while public inter-island ferries charge MVR 30-75. Most of these operate from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Although it is the best option for budget travellers, there are a number of downsides to these ferries that might make you want to reconsider this choice. Ferries are usually off scheduled and thus, unreliable. Also, note that the ferries do not stop at the resort islands and nor do they operate on Fridays.</p>
